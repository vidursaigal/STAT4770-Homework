    "In this question you will estimate how many throws on average it takes to get three sixes in a row, using a fair die.\n",
    "You will write code for a Monte Carlo simulation that has 10000 iterations.\n",
    "This question is quite similar in structure to the \"Ace occurs\" example in the Module 2 slides so I suggest you review that first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Process:\n",
    "* First create an empty list that will store the results of each iteration. Call it \"vals\".\n",
    "* Next create a variable that indicates the number of iterations (10000) for the simulation. Call it \"num_its\".\n",
    "* Write a for loop that iterates 10000 times:\n",
    "* Inside the for loop create a variable to count the number of throws until you see three sixes in a row. Call it \"counter\" and initialize it to the value 3.\n",
    "* Inside the for loop create an initial list, called recent_three, with the first three rolls of the die. Here's code that will do that for you:\n",
    "`recent_three = [np.random.randint(low=1,high=7), np.random.randint(low=1,high=7), np.random.randint(low=1,high=7)]`.\n",
    "* Use a while statement inside the for loop that keeps going until you get three sixes in a row. An easy way to do this is to check whether the sum of the last three throws equals 18. \n",
    "    * **Inside** the while loop you should increase your throws counter by 1.\n",
    "    * **Inside** the while loop remove the first element from the recent_three list.\n",
    "    * **Inside** the while loop throw a die again and append its value to the recent_three list.\n",
    "* When the while loop exits, append the number of throws counter to the \"vals\" list.\n",
    "* Finally, find the average of the numbers inside the vals list.\n",
    "* If you have done this correctly you should get an answer close to 258.\n",
    "* If you inadvertently create an infinite while loop (the character inside the 'In []:' cell identifier remains a \"\\*\"), then hit the square button in the tool bar to 'interrupt the kernel'.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you develop the code I suggest setting iterations at a small number (like 10) so you don't waste time waiting for the simulation to run.\n",
