Fortunately pandas has a built in method to do this which is called '.pct_change()'. Use this function to add a new column to the existing data frame called 'Return'. There is a subtelty here in that the dataframe is ordered from most recent price in the first row, to oldest price in the last row, which is unusual for a time series. For the pct_change method to work properly we need to first reverse the row order in the data frame.\n",
