    "a. It is common to want to transform prices into returns. The formula is $R_t = \\frac{P_t - P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}$. Here, $R_t$ is the return for time t, and $P_t$ is the price at time t. Fortunately pandas has a built in method to do this which is called '.pct_change()'. Use this function to add a new column to the existing data frame called 'Return'. There is a subtelty here in that the dataframe is ordered from most recent price in the first row, to oldest price in the last row, which is unusual for a time series. For the pct_change method to work properly we need to first reverse the row order in the data frame.\n",
